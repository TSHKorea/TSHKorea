- 👋 Hi, I’m @TSHKorea
- 👀 I’m interested in creating and making my own computer hardware by myself.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about 3D cading and coding in our software specialized high school
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Cutie Pi tablet based on the Raspberry Pi 4
- 📫 How to reach me .. I'm currently considering to make my self designed tablet computer and customize a Raspberry Pi OS from the original design to my own design. 


<!---

I'm high school student in Korea and the knowledge of the Raspberry Pi, including a software customizing or hardware datasheet, is super rarely be found in our national poor forum..
I hope you guys to contact to my email>>tshkorea@gmail.com share some useful information about this and cooperate to my project!! Thanks :)
